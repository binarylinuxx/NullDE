*** This version (0.4.3) adds compatibility with Blender 4.3 (use addon version 1.2 for earlier versions of Blender) ***

Grease Pencil to Curves add-on allows you to easily smooth the lines drawn with Grease Pencil in Blender, reduce the number of vertices, and convert to curves with one button.  This eliminates a lot of work in shaping Bezier curves from scratch.  You can also convert the resulting curve to a hair curve attached to a surface with a single click, allowing you to turn multiple grease pencil strokes into hair curves that are already aligned to the surface (giving you a head start in grooming).  Each grease pencil layer creates a separate curve.  You also have the option to resample generated curves to increase points.

The add-on menu appears in the N-Panel within the "Edit" tab.

In the addon overview on Youtube, I demonstrate a line drawn with Grease Pencil converted a curve to quickly create a chain and a string of lights.  I then generate a whole head of hair from grease pencil strokes.

You can do all of this manually, but this addon does all the conversion, adjusting number of segments, smoothing, and attaching more easily in a single menu.  You can download it for free from Gumroad.  Let me know what you think.  Any suggestions for improvements are welcome!
